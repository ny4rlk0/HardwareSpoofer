p.exe is enough for fooling any windows id based bans. However it will not change your hardware serial numbers. Open once, click the ui once. Then you can closed as it is changed your Windows installation id with random generated id and changes some other windows identifying things and deletes some regedit keys about valorant etc. p.exe is confirmed for working and is open source. You just need to decrypt parts you wonder with pVariableDecoder.exe. I'm not recommending to run any of the programs in this repo if you encrypted your drive with bitlocker. It might f*** it up.

Also i'm pretty sure efi spoofer is not working and mess of a code. Also you need edk2 and others if you gonna write a efi.
